## Git Workflow
### Terminology
* Local: Refers to code hosted on your machine, your local clientside computer
* Remove: Refers to code hosted in the cloud, i.e., the GitHub repository
* Branch: Like trees in Computer Science, think of Git as a series of branches with one dominant trunk. The trunk is what we typically refer to as the master branch where as all other branches are logical representations of the trunk. Branches are used for isolating development code and experiementing or simply taking projects in an entirely new direction. 
* Merge: The process of merging two separate branches into one singular entity.
* Origin: naming convention usually referencing the remote repository

### Commands
* git clone https://www.github.com/[user]/[project].git - duplicates remote github code onto your local machine
* git branch [name] - creates a new local branch
* git checkout [name] - makes the [name] the active branch
* git reset --hard origin/[name] - if you fuck up bad enough, use this command to reset the state of your local active branch to the state of the remote [name] branch
* git pull origin [name] - this is a shortcut command that performs a fetch/merge operation. It attempts to automerge the code from the remote origin [name] branch into your [name] branch.
