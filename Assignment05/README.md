# Assignment 5

All of the course documents are located in Google Drive.
This assignment is *very* easy. I may actually have it completed
by tonight or tomorrow.

We can have the week off or start on Assignment 6 which might be
a good idea :)

I left you guys a simple python script if you want to run through
the algorithms yourself. It it simply used to calculate the total
distance of the arm movement and makes life much easier.
